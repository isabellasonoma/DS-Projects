## Monte Carlo with Equities
This project allowed me to practice using a Monte Carlo Simulation. I used equity data from the Yahoo website.

First, I found the daily closing price for a stock and plotted the price for a certain time period.

Then, I found the log returns of each day to see how the price changed over a period of time.<br/>

This data allowed me to do a Monte Carlo Simulation. There were two elements of this simulation: drift and randomness.<br/>
